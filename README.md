# Poketeam with a Pokedream

As a team of four, we developed a website from scratch using _JavaScript_ and _React_ at KTH. In addition, we hosted the website on _Heroku_ and _Firebase_ and added cloud support.

If you wish to test the website for yourself, you may download the necessary files and initiate a local server using the designated folder. You can then run the server by opening _React.html_ and starting a Python server using the command _"python -m http.server."_ Once the server is running, you can access the website by entering _"#search"_ after the localhost address (e.g. _http://localhost:8000/react.html#search_). Note that the port number may vary.
